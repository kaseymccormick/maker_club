    <h1>Week 2</h1>

<div class="article_content">
<p> After learning last week how much time flies I tried harder to plan ahead and pace steps. Although we seemed okay there still just wasn't enough time. Mainly because we had more fun in discussions and observations than I originally planned. We started with the snack and filling out the worksheet. Then I handed out prototypes, markers, and the poster(pictured below) to teams I organized. One member from each 5th grade class was in each team in order to not have just same classroom members together.</p>
    <p>With each prototype they had to observe the materials and identify pro's and con's of the protoptype as a whole on the poster paper. I first explained the left hand side had them fill it out as teams, and then explained the pro's and con's T chart to have them fill out. I only had one rule that each person on the team had to write at least once, with the markers I provided. I did this to avoid having the <em>good handwriting</em> student stuck doing all the writing. And to see how they would divide the 3 marker colors of red, blue and green. I was interested if each kid would own a marker or if the colors would be for different sections. Once all observations and enough pro's and con's were written we discussed them as a group.</p>
    <p>At this time I was admittedly running low on time so I held each prototype up, explained the textures and asked the teams to explain how they described it then one pro and con. I also passed the additional prototypes around so the students could see the various types. From their observations we discussed the materials I chose for the sketchbooks, a hard cardboard backing, foam cover and rubber band with paperclip binding while the materials of each were passed out.</p>
    <p>I had the most fun watching them observe, record, and discuss the prototypes. Watching them piece together their ideas and then the joy when I confirmed what the material was. There are a few sketchbooks that need paper, and a few students who were a bit bummed on the time crunch but all and all I'd call it successful. Below the materials list are the pictures of the posters, and the corresponding prototypes for those that are curious.</p>
