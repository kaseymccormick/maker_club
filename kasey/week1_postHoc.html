    <h1>Week 1</h1>

<div class="article_content">
<p> I've been excited and anxious for this first week, for weeks. Two weeks prior I started packing up my materials and unpacking them just to repack them and make sure I had everything. Before that, I spent quite a few nights prototyping out the projects we'd do. I gathered a few ideas from Pinterest and set to work on making them easily reproducible, kid friendly, and cheap. I landed on a color wheel made with foamcore and a sketchbook bound by a paperclip and rubber band as the goals to be completed the first meeting. I quickly learned, it was good intentions but not enough time. The color wheels reached 90% completion at best, with the ~50 minutes allotted.</p>
    <p>I already knew to have my <em>lesson plans</em> as <a href="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAALoAAAAJGY3MzQ5ZjcyLWQyYzQtNDhlNC04YjllLTA0Njk2MjdmOTIzNQ.gif"> guidelines really,</a> but didn't grasp how fluid and cognisant of the clock to be. Time flies when you're having fun painting. At the start snacks are handed out, fruit snacks or goldfish, as that's what I found at Costco. I introduce what we'll be accomplishing for this meeting and then start asking for volunteers to hand out items. As this project was supply heavy almost everyone had a job to do. I also tried when asking for a students help to ask their name and repeat it back to them. I also told them to please correct me if I pronounce it wrong, and that I related to how frustrating it is to be called another name as I've been called Cassie several times. </p>
    <p>The color wheel I constructed out of foamcore to be durable and with some mass, and a transparent top so you can see all of the colors. Students write with sharpies on top of the transparency as many color combination names as they'd like. A dab of 90% Rubbing Alchol on a paper towel wipes the sharpie away. I had seen several paper versions that show the relations but not all the colors and wanted a bit more substaintial. Instead of a brass brad I used a stickpin that's curved into the back to secure the pieces. Although this works I see why now most kid friendly creations use the brads even if they don't allow so great of movement, as they'd be able to complete assembly without my help.</p>
    <p>After receiving all of the materials they drew the lines to seprate the circle into 12 seperate parts then proceded to paint with the colors provided. I gave them orange, green and purple as they're often hard to get just right and would ease the process a bit. They then mixed the additional colors and by the time that was done we needed to clean up. I'll do a step by step write up of the color wheel, with pictures, within the next 12 days rather then including it in this post.</p>
    <p>From this first week i've decided to use a timer of some sort that goes off every 15 minutes to keep myself or the group in check. I haven't decided if the noise would be beneficial to us all yet. And to not try and cram so much into one ~50 minute time period. Also every time a student runs into a problem I try and follow the same steps. First to ask questions about the problem, then say there's often more then one solution to a problem and ask if they have solution ideas. If they do we talk about them. If they don't, I ask if they'd like a bit to think, want to talk it out with me or we ask the group for help. So far 2/3 have had at least one solution idea.</p>
