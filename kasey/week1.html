    <h1>Week 1</h1>

<div class="article_content">
<p> I've been excited and anxious for this first week, for weeks. Two weeks prior I started packing up my materials and unpacking them just to repack them and make sure I had everything. Before that, I spent quite a few nights prototyping out the projects we'd do. I gathered a few ideas from Pinterest and set to work on making them easily reproducible, kid friendly, and cheap. I landed on a color wheel made with foamcore and a sketchbook bound by a paperclip and rubber band as the goals to be completed the first meeting. I quickly learned, it was good intentions but not enough time. The color wheels reached 90% completion at best, with the ~50 minutes allotted.</p>
    <p>I already knew to have my <em>lesson plans</em> as <a href="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAALoAAAAJGY3MzQ5ZjcyLWQyYzQtNDhlNC04YjllLTA0Njk2MjdmOTIzNQ.gif"> guidelines really,</a> but didn't grasp how fluid and cognisant of the clock to be. Time flies when you're having fun painting. At the start snacks are handed out, fruit snacks or goldfish, as that's what I found at Costco. I introduce what we'll be accomplishing for this meeting and then start asking for volunteers to hand out items. As this project was supply heavy almost everyone had a job to do. I also tried when asking for a students help to ask their name and repeat it back to them. I also told them to please correct me if I pronounce it wrong, and that I related to how frustrating it is to be called another name as I've been called Cassie several times. </p>
    <p>The color wheel I constructed out of foamcore to be durable and with some mass, and a transparent top so you can see all of the colors. Students write with sharpies on top of the transparency as many color combination names as they'd like. A dab of 90% Rubbing Alchol on a paper towel wipes the sharpie away. I had seen several paper versions that show the relations but not all the colors and wanted a bit more substaintial. Instead of a brass brad I used a stickpin that's curved into the back to secure the pieces. Although this works I see why now most kid friendly creations use the brads even if they don't allow so great of movement, as they'd be able to complete assembly without my help.</p>
