#Maker-Club_pure
A website to collect the creations, lessons and musings of maker club. Written in HTML CSS and Javascript so the students can make their own pages and understand the code I write for our pages. I annoate repositories that have no back end or database to speak of with `_pure`

## The short and sweet of it

**Who**
A group of 16 5th graders and myself as well as a 5th grade teacher, comprise of maker club.


**What**
Maker club's primary goal is to teach problem solving techniques for and using design, code and 3D printing.


**When**
Meets once a week for 13 weeks, after school.


**Where**
In an elementary school either in a classroom or computer lab.

**Why**

For me, to overcome imposter syndrom by teaching others and wanting to be around a group of people who want to learn, they just happen to be kids. 

For them, to hopefully give them insight on design, development and 3d printing as well as different ways to solve problems. I try and stress everything we're creating, even if i came up with it, is to solve a problem that we have.
